Variables:
String total
String selection
double inputOne
double inputTwo

CalculatorGui Class:
Main()
initialize():void

CalculateDriver Class:
multiply(double one,double two):String total
divide(double one, double two):String total
subtract(double one, double two):String total
add(double one, double two):String total

Psuedo Code:
initializes variables total, selection, inputOne, and inputTwo.
take first input from user and hold in inputOne when one of calculate buttons is selected.
add string of type of calculation(i.e. "multiply" when multiply selected) to var selection
clear first input from textfield when button selected.
take second input from user and hold in inputTwo.
caluclate first and second input when enter button is pressed based on what String var selection holds.
put end calculation into total.
display total on textfield.

clear button will reinitializes inputOne, inputTwo, and total to zero.

multiply:return String total(double one, double two) 
takes two variables passed into function and multiplies them together.
parse total into string
returns total of two variables when multiplied.

divide: return String total(double one, double two)
check second variable is not zero if so pass error message to main.
takes two variables passed into function and divides them.
parse double total into string
return total.

subtract:return String total(double one, double two)
takes two variables passed into function and subtracts them.
parse double total into string
return total.

add:return String total(double one, double two)
takes two variables passed into function and subtracts them.
parse double total into string
return total.

initialize()
set total to 0
set inputOne to 0
set inputTwo to 0
